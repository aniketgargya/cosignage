                <h1>Why Cosignage?</h1>
                <h2>Cosignage is a Coronavirus-communication signage aimed to support local businesses.</h2>
                <p>Take Jerry’s Pizza, for example. A local pizza parlor that has been a family-favorite for the past 10 years. As the regulations change, Jerry’s is able to offer outdoor seating and curbside pickup, but requires all customers to wear masks and enforces a strict 30-person maximum occupancy due to their size. Unable to afford costly signage and other advertising methods, Jerry’s struggles to efficiently communicate their available services with customers.</p>
                <p>Jerry’s Pizza’s story isn’t unique. Hundreds of businesses across the nation are facing the same issues as they begin to reopen. In the rapidly changing competitive market landscape, having accurate, effective signage is absolutely essential for communication between businesses and customers.</p>
                <h2>Another heading for the following paragraphs.</h2>
